This deep understanding is our foundation. Now let's discover where the opportunities lie."

Phase 2: Define (20 minutes)
"Now let's synthesize what we've learned into a clear problem statement. Our challenge is not just technical—it's human-centered. 

Let me share the framework for defining our challenge:
- Who are we designing for?
- What is their real need?
- Why is this important?

Use this template: '[User persona] needs [need] because [insight].'"

Phase 3: Ideate (45 minutes)
"Now for the creative part. We're going to generate as many ideas as possible. Remember: quantity over quality at this stage. No idea is too wild or too simple.

Let's use these techniques:
- Brainstorming with structured prompts
- SCAMPER technique (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse)
- Crazy 8s rapid ideation

I'll give you 8 minutes to sketch 8 different solutions. Go!"

Phase 4: Prototype (60 minutes)
"Great ideas need to become tangible. Let's build low-fidelity prototypes that we can test. These don't need to be perfect—they need to be testable.

Choose your most promising idea and create:
- A simple mockup or storyboard
- A role-playing scenario
- A process diagram

The goal is to make your idea real enough to get feedback."

Phase 5: Test (45 minutes)
"Now let's test these prototypes with real users. This is about learning, not proving we're right.

Test protocol:
1. Introduce the scenario
2. Observe user interaction
3. Ask about their experience
4. Document insights and surprises
5. Iterate based on feedback

Remember: every piece of feedback is valuable—even the critical ones."

Our objectives today:
1. Align on our strategic direction
2. Identify key initiatives
3. Allocate resources
4. Establish accountability

Let's start by grounding ourselves in our current reality."

Current State Assessment (45 minutes)

Use the SWOT framework:
- Strengths: What do we do better than anyone?
- Weaknesses: Where are we struggling?
- Opportunities: What trends can we leverage?
- Threats: What keeps you up at night?

[Facilitate group analysis and documentation]

This honest assessment is our starting point. Now let's dream about where we're going."

Vision Creation (30 minutes)

Questions to guide us:
- What would success look like in 3 years?

- What will our industry look like?
- What impact will we have made?

Create a vision statement that captures this future. Make it memorable. Make it actionable."

"Here's where strategy meets execution. We have our vision; now we need the path to get there.

Strategic Framework:
1. Strategic Pillars (3-4 key areas of focus)
2. Key Initiatives (specific programs/projects)
3. Success Metrics (how we'll measure progress)
4. Resource Requirements (what we need to invest)

Let's work through this systematically, pillar by pillar."

Action Planning (60 minutes)
"Strategy without execution is just hallucination. Let's make this real.

For each key initiative, we'll define:
- Specific objectives and outcomes
- Timeline and milestones
- Resource allocation
- Owner and accountability
- Success metrics
- Risk mitigation plans

This is where the rubber meets the road."

Commitment and Next Steps (20 minutes)
"We've built a comprehensive plan. Now let's commit to making it happen.

Protocol:
1. Each person commits to specific deliverables
2. We'll schedule regular review checkpoints
3. We'll communicate this plan broadly
4. We'll adjust based on learning

Who's ready to make this happen?"
